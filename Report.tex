\section*{Introduction} 
The program detailed in this report is an implementation of Erik Fransson's \textit{QR World} cellular automation with a graphical representation in Haskell.


%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\section{Documentation}%Explanation of code workings, functions and structure.
\subsection{Design and Technical Decisions}
% Describe what each relevant function does conceptually. (i.e. how does it get you closer to solving the problems outlined in this assignment spec?)
% How do these functions piece together to make the finished program? Why did you design and implement it this way?
% What major design choices did you make regarding the functions that youâ€™ve written and the overall structure of your program?
\paragraph{Task 1}
\paragraph{Task 2}


\subsection{Structure}



 \subsection{Assumptions}%Describe assumptions you have made about how a user might use the program and how this has influenced your design decisions.


%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\section{Testing}%How did I test the program focus on methodology and testing groups
%How did you test individual functions?
%Be specific about this - the tutors know that you have tested your program, but they want to know how.
%Describe the tests that prove individual functions on their own behave as expected (i.e. testing a function with different inputs and doing a calculation by hand to check that the outputs are correct).
%How did you test the entire program? What tests did you perform to show that the program behaves as expected in all (even unusual) cases?


%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\section{Reflection}
%Discuss the reasoning behind your decisions, rather than what the decisions were. You can reflect on not only the decisions you made, but the process through which you developed the final program:
  %Did you encounter any conceptual or technical issues?
    %If you solved them, describe the relevant details of what happened and how you overcame them.
    %Sometimes limitations on time or technical skills can limit how much of the assignment can be completed. If you ran into a problem that you could not solve, then your report is the perfect place to describe them. Try to include details such as:
      %theories as to what caused the problem;
      %suggestions of things that might have fixed it; and
      %discussion about what you did try, and the results of these attempts.
  %What would you have done differently if you were to do it again
    %What changes to the design and structure you would make if you wrote the program again from scratch?
%Are parts of the program confusing for the reader? You can explain them in the report (in this situation you should also make use of comments in your code).
  %If you collaborated with others, what was the nature of the collaboration? (Note that you are only allowed to collaborate by discussing concepts, not sharing solutions.)
  %Collaborating is any discussion or work done together on planning or writing your assignment.
%Other info
  %You may like to briefly discuss details of events which were relevant to your process of design - strange or interesting things that you noticed and fixed along the way.
